Existing approaches, however, primarily focus on improving accuracy and overlook other aspects such as robustness and interpretability. In this paper, we propose adversarial modifications for link prediction models: identifying the fact to add into or remove from the knowledge graph that changes the prediction for a target fact after the model is retrained. Using these single modifications of the graph, we identify the most influential fact for a predicted link and evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the addition of fake facts. We introduce an efficient approach to estimate the effect of such modifications by approximating the change in the embeddings when the knowledge graph changes. To avoid the combinatorial search over all possible facts, we train a network to decode embeddings to their corresponding graph components, allowing the use of gradient-based optimization to identify the adversarial modification. We use these techniques to evaluate the robustness of link prediction models (by measuring sensitivity to additional facts), study interpretability through the facts most responsible for predictions (by identifying the most influential neighbors), and detect incorrect facts in the knowledge base.",

Detecting the different ways in which language is gendered is an important task since gendered language can bias NLP models (such as for coreference resolution). This task is challenging since genderedness is often expressed in subtle ways. Existing approaches need considerable annotation efforts for each language, domain, and author, and often require handcrafted lexicons and features. Additionally, these approaches do not provide a quantifiable measure of how gendered the text is, nor are they applicable at the fine-grained mention level.<br>In this paper, we use existing NLP pipelines to automatically annotate gender of mentions in the text. On corpora labeled using this method, we train a supervised classifier to predict the gender of any mention from its context and evaluate it on unseen text. The model confidence for a mention's gender can be used as a proxy to indicate the level of genderedness of the context. We test this gendered language detector on movie summaries, movie reviews, news articles, and fiction novels, achieving an AUC-ROC of up to 0.71, and observe that the model predictions agree with human judgments collected for this task.

In this crowdsourced, adversarially-created, 55k-question benchmark, a system must resolve references in a question, perhaps to multiple input positions, and perform discrete operations over them (such as addition, counting, or sorting). These operations require a much more comprehensive understanding of the content of paragraphs, as they remove the paraphrase-and-entity-typing shortcuts available in prior datasets.  We apply state-of-the-art methods from both the reading comprehension and semantic parsing literatures on this dataset and show that the best systems only achieve 38.4% F1 on our generalized accuracy metric, while expert human performance is 96%.

To this end, we build PoMo, a post-modifier dataset created automatically from news articles reflecting a journalistic need for incorporating entity information that is relevant to a particular news event.

Our results show there is large room for improvement in terms of both identifying relevant facts to include (knowing which claims are relevant gives a >20% improvement in BLEU score), and generating appropriate post-modifier text for the context (providing relevant claims is not sufficient for accurate generation).

Existing approaches, however, primarily focus on simple link structure between a finite set of entities, ignoring the variety of data types that are often used in knowledge bases, such as text, images, and numerical values. In this paper, we propose multimodal knowledge base embeddings (MKBE) that use different neural encoders for this variety of observed data, and combine them with existing relational models to learn embeddings of the entities and multimodal data. Further, using these learned embedings and different neural decoders, we introduce a novel multimodal imputation model to generate missing multimodal values, like text and images, from information in the knowledge base. We enrich existing relational datasets to create two novel benchmarks that contain additional information such as textual descriptions and images of the original entities. We demonstrate that our models utilize this additional information effectively to provide more accurate link prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results with a considerable gap of 5-7% over existing methods. Further, we evaluate the quality of our generated multimodal values via a user study.",

However, many real-world question answering problems require the reading of text not because it contains the literal answer, but because it contains a recipe to derive an answer together with the reader's background knowledge. One example is the task of interpreting regulations to answer \"Can I...?\" or \"Do I have to...?\" questions such as \"I am working in Canada. Do I have to carry on paying UK National Insurance?\" after reading a UK government website about this topic. This task requires both the interpretation of rules and the application of background knowledge. It is further complicated due to the fact that, in practice, most questions are underspecified, and a human assistant will regularly have to ask clarification questions such as \"How long have you been working abroad?\" when the answer cannot be directly derived from the question and text. In this paper, we formalise this task and develop a crowd-sourcing strategy to collect 32k task instances based on real-world rules and crowd-generated questions and scenarios. We analyse the challenges of this task and assess its difficulty by evaluating the performance of rule-based and machine-learning baselines. We observe promising results when no background knowledge is necessary, and substantial room for improvement whenever background knowledge is needed.",

To automatically detect this behavior for individual instances, we present semantically equivalent adversaries (SEAs) – semantic-preserving perturbations that induce changes in the model’s predictions. We generalize these adversaries into semantically equivalent adversarial rules (SEARs) – simple, universal replacement rules that induce adversaries on many instances. We demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of SEAs and SEARs by detecting bugs in black-box state-of-the-art models for three domains: machine comprehension, visual question-answering, and sentiment analysis. Via user studies, we demonstrate that we generate high-quality local adversaries for more instances than humans, and that SEARs induce four times as many mistakes as the bugs discovered by human experts. SEARs are also actionable: retraining models using data augmentation significantly reduces bugs, while maintaining accuracy.",

We present a novel framework that utilizes black-box function evaluations, in conjunction with symbolic expressions that define relationships between the given functions. We employ tree LSTMs to incorporate the structure of the symbolic expression trees. We use tree encoding for numbers present in function evaluation data, based on their decimal representation.

To perform such a rapid damage mapping, a series of tile-based image split analysis is employed to generate the data set. Next, a selection algorithm with the SqueezeNet network is developed to swiftly distinguish between built-up (BU) and nonbuilt-up regions. Finally, a recognition algorithm with a modified wide residual network is developed to classify the BU regions into wash away, collapsed, and slightly damaged regions. Experiments performed on the TerraSAR-X data from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan show a BU region extraction accuracy of 80.4% and a damage-level recognition accuracy of 74.8%, respectively. Our framework takes around 2 h to train on a new region, and only several minutes for prediction."

Three approaches for distributing observation detection workload between sensing and processing devices are considered for sensor systems within wireless islands. Each of the approaches is formulated for the shared configuration of a sensor-edge system, in which the network structure, observation monitoring problem, and machine learning-based detector implementing it are not modified. For every approach, a high-level strategy for realization of the detector for different assumptions on the relation between its complexity and the system's constraints is considered. In each case, the potential for the constraints' satisfaction is shown to exist and be exploitable via division, approximation, and delegation of the detector's workload to the sensing devices off the edge processor.

    "abstractText" : "Many real world systems need to operate on heterogeneous information networks that consist of numerous interacting components of different types. Examples include systems that perform data analysis on biological information networks; social networks; and information extraction systems processing unstructured data to convert raw text to knowledge graphs. Many previous works describe specialized approaches to perform specific types of analysis, mining and learning on such networks. In this work, we propose a unified framework consisting of a data model -a graph with a first order schema along with a declarative language for constructing, querying and manipulating such networks in ways that facilitate relational and structured machine learning. In particular, we provide an initial prototype for a relational and graph traversal query language where queries are directly used as relational features for structured machine learning models. Feature extraction is performed by making declarative graph traversal queries. Learning and inference models can directly operate on this relational representation and augment it with new data and knowledge that, in turn, is integrated seamlessly into the relational structure to support new predictions. We demonstrate this system's capabilities by showcasing tasks in natural language processing and computational biology domains."

However, it is not clear what kind of explanations, such as linear models, decision trees, and rule lists, are the appropriate family to consider, and different tasks and models may benefit from different kinds of explanations. Instead of picking a single family of representations, in this work we propose to use \"programs\" as model-agnostic explanations. We show that small programs can be expressive yet intuitive as explanations, and generalize over a number of existing interpretable families. We propose a prototype program induction method based on simulated annealing that approximates the local behavior of black-box classifiers around a specific prediction using random perturbations. Finally, we present preliminary application on small datasets and show that the generated explanations are intuitive and accurate for a number of classifiers."

In this paper, we introduce Moro, a software tool for easily creating and presenting AI-friendly teaching materials. Moro notebooks integrate content of different types (text, math, code, images), allow real-time interactions via modifiable and executable code blocks, and are viewable in browsers both as long-form pages and as presentations. Creating notebooks is easy and intuitive; the creation tool is also in-browser, is WYSIWYG for quick iterations of editing, and supports a variety of shortcuts and customizations for efficiency. We present three deployed case studies of Moro that widely differ from each other, demonstrating its utility in a variety of scenarios such as in-class teaching and conference tutorials."

Unfortunately, these methods share a shortcoming with all other distantly supervised approaches: they cannot learn to extract target relations without existing data in the knowledge base, and likewise, these models are inaccurate for relations with sparse data. Rule-based extractors, on the other hand, can be easily extended to novel relations and improved for existing but inaccurate relations, through first-order formulae that capture auxiliary domain knowledge. However, usually a large set of such formulae is necessary to achieve generalization.<br>In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for learning low-dimensional embeddings of entity-pairs and relations that combine the advantages of matrix factorization with first-order logic domain knowledge. We introduce simple approaches for estimating such embeddings, as well as a novel training algorithm to jointly optimize over factual and first-order logic information. Our results show that this method is able to learn accurate extractors with little or no distant supervision alignments, while at the same time generalizing to textual patterns that do not appear in the formulae.",

    "abstractText" : "With the physical constraints of semiconductor-based electronics becoming increasingly limiting in the past decade, single-core CPUs have given way to multi-core and distributed computing platforms. At the same time, access to large data collections is progressively becoming commonplace due to the lowering cost of storage and bandwidth. Traditional machine learning paradigms that have been designed to operate sequentially on single processor architectures seem destined to become obsolete in this world of multi-core, multi-node systems and massive data sets. Inference for graphical models is one such example for which most existing algorithms are sequential in nature and are difficult to scale using parallel computations. Further, modeling large datasets leads to an escalation in the number of variables, factors, domains, and the density of the models, all of which have a substantial impact on the computational and storage complexity of inference. To achieve scalability, existing techniques impose strict independence assumptions on the model, resulting in tractable inference at the expense of expressiveness, and therefore of accuracy and utility, of the model.<br>Motivated by the need to scale inference to large, dense graphical models, in this thesis we explore approximations to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and belief propagation (BP) that induce dynamic sparsity in the model to utilize parallelism. In particular, since computations over some factors, variables, and values are more important than over others at different stages of inference, proposed approximations that prioritize and parallelize such computations facilitate efficient inference. First, we show that a synchronously distributed MCMC algorithm that uses dynamic partitioning of the model achieves scalable inference. We then identify bottlenecks in the synchronous architecture, and demonstrate that a collection of MCMC techniques that use asynchronous updates are able to address these drawbacks. For large domains and high-order factors, we find that dynamically inducing sparsity in variable domains, results in scalable belief propagation that enables joint inference. We also show that formulating distributed BP and joint inference as generalized BP on cluster graphs, and by using cluster message approximations, provides significantly lower communication cost and running time.With these tools for inference in hand, we are able to tackle entity tagging, relation extraction, entity resolution, cross-document coreference, joint inference, and other information extraction tasks over large text corpora.",

However, adoption has been slow due to the high level of expertise expected both in probability and in the domain from the user. Instead of requiring a domain expert to specify the probabilistic dependencies of the data, we present an approach that uses the relational DB schema to automatically construct a Bayesian graphical model for a database. This resulting model contains customized distributions for the attributes, latent variables that cluster the records, and factors that reflect and represent the foreign key links, whilst allowing efficient inference. Experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the model and scalability of inference on synthetic and real-world data.",

The technique enlarges the set of relations in an ontology, e.g., TACKBP slots, to contain all surface patterns between pairs of entities in a large corpus.

This differs fundamentally from traditional relation extraction approaches because an entire knowledge base is constructed jointly over train and test data. To produce submissions for the slot filling and cold start tasks, we simply query this knowledge base.

However, since alignment itself is a challenging task and is often noisy, existing systems either align conservatively, resulting in very few links, or combine the attributes of multiple candidates, leading to a conflation of entities. Our approach instead performs joint inference between within-document coreference and entity linking, maintaining ranked lists of candidate entities that are dynamically merged and reranked during inference. Further, we incorporate a large set of surface string variations for each entity by using anchor texts from the web that link to the entity. These forms of global context enables our system to improve classifier-based coreference by 1.09 B3 F1 points, and improve over the previous state-of-art by 0.41 points, thus introducing a new state-of-art result on the ACE 2004 data.",

Previous work provides useful approximations to facilitate inference on such models, but lacks important anytime properties such as: 1) providing accurate and consistent marginals when stopped early, 2) improving the approximation when run longer, and 3) converging to the fixed point of BP. To this end, we propose a message passing algorithm that works on sparse (partially instantiated) domains, and converges to consistent marginals using dynamic message scheduling. The algorithm grows the sparse domains incrementally, selecting the next value to add using prioritization schemes based on the gradients of the marginal inference objective. Our experiments demonstrate local anytime consistency and fast convergence, providing significant speedups over BP to obtain low-error marginals: up to 25 times on grid models, and up to 6 times on a real-world natural language processing task.",

However, the scarcity of large labeled data sets has hindered supervised machine learning research for this task. In this paper we develop and demonstrate an approach based on ``distantly-labeling'' a data set from which we can train a discriminative cross-document coreference model. In particular we build a dataset of more than a million people mentions extracted from 3.5 years of New York Times articles, leverage Wikipedia for distant labeling with a generative model (and measure the reliability of such labeling); then we train and evaluate a conditional random field coreference model that has factors on cross-document entities as well as mention-pairs. This coreference model obtains high accuracy in resolving mentions and entities that are not present in the training data, indicating applicability to non-Wikipedia data.
